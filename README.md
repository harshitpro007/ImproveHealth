Additionally, the system facilitates fee collection, notice of offers, and arbitration processes seamlessly.

Key Features:-
1. Advanced OCR capabilities for efficient document scanning and data extraction.
2. User-friendly interface with role-based access control for secure data management.
3. Automated fee collection and notice of offer processes streamline administrative tasks.
4. Integration with federal portals ensures compliance and seamless arbitration proceedings.
5. Real-time notifications and status updates facilitate smooth case management and decision-making.

By integrating cutting-edge technology with robust functionalities, our web application optimizes eligibility verification and case management processes. It enhances efficiency, reduces manual workload, and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements, ultimately improving the overall workflow and decision-making process.
